# Chaitin School

We are a community of people interested in software engineering as a fun
activity of leisure time as well as a craft to become skilled at. 

## Community

To get involved with our community, just attend an event! One can also [join
our Discord community](https://discord.gg/bzjKNG4bUU), which is where we
organise our events.

Check out our [website](https://chaitinschool.org/) and our
[Code of Conduct](https://chaitinschool.org/code-of-conduct/).

## Events

Our [events](https://chaitinschool.org/events/) range from presentations to
reading groups and hack nights. We usually aim to have events that incorporate
participation from all attendees, rather than lecture-style ones.

## About

Programming is a fun skill we want to become better at. We value learning
together rather than alone. We are a school because the etymological definition
of school is “leisure time”. We are a school that is:

* not only for beginners
* not online
* not based on a teacher-student model
* not transaction-based
